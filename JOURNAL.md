May 18th: Planning and Basic Design
I started my project by choosing constraints and the optimal materials / gear ratios for my project.
I decided on utilizing 67102RS, MF126ZZ, and MF128ZZ bearings, and the use of DIN 965 and DIN 9647 (Hex socker countersink/button head) M3 and M4 screws, as all these parts are cheap and can be obtained off of Amazon and AliExpress.
I then needed to decide what electronics to use, and went with the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) architecture as I have experience with these parts and already own some of the electronics needed. Using [goBILDA YellowJacket motors](https://www.gobilda.com/modern-robotics-12vdc-motor/) along with [DSSSERVO brushless servos](https://tinyurl.com/abacadabaDSSERVO) in conjunction with [mt6701 encoders i got from Melonbotics](https://www.melonbotics.com/products/barecoder-micro) made sure I keep my project affordable while having the same power as other swerve drives, such as FTC teams 16917 and 22105.
After knowing what main parts were necessary, I simulated the optimal gear ratio using a modifed FRC drivetrain calculator to determine that a 9:1 gear ratio on a 64mm wheel has the perfect balance between speed, acceleration, and traction on the FTC field.

However, I could not find good traction wheels online that matched the size I wanted (64mm), and decided to mold my own tread out of [VytaFlex 60](https://www.smooth-on.com/products/vytaflex-60/), a 60a durometer urethane. I've molded wheels in the past out of 30a silicone, but had little success since the tread easily peeled off of the wheel.
