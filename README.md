# Palindromic Coaxial Swerve
**What is it?**: A coaxial swerve drivetrain, combining the speed of traction wheels with the holonomic movement of mecanum wheels by physically swiveling the wheel with a servo.
**What makes PCS Unique?**: Palindromic Coaxial Swerve revolves around FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) hardware, and only requires 400$ of new parts for teams to build.
**Why use swerve?**: Swerve drive, when done right, allows for a significant boost in traction and speed compared to mecanum wheels, allowing for high power movement and pushing for many applications such as battlebots, FTC, and more.

## The Basics:

550 series DC motors: Drives the wheel

Brushless Servos: Swivels each Pod

3 stage Reduction: 6000 to 750 RPM in a small form-factor.


## Unique features:

**Belt-Driven 2nd stage for modular gear ratio**: Utilizing timing belts instead of spur gears allows for a quick gear ratio change with the change of just 2 parts.

**Molded Wheels for extreme traction**: Using Custom 60a urethane wheels increases traction and top-speed while reducing wheel slip.

**"Mega frame"**: A single 300x300x6mm aluminum sheet holds the pods, servos, and everything else you need!
